From the Quiz:

npm install --save-exact react@rc react-dom@rc

This command installs the specified versions of react and react-dom as exact release candidates (rc), ensuring no version discrepancies.

In order to properly execute npm run dev, apparently each exercise folder, e.g. 02_02b etc, need to have Vite installed. So every time you're working in new exercise folder, do the following steps:

cd folder (e.g 02_02b)
npm create vite@latest react-project -- --template react
\*\* the post instructions will ask you to run

cd react-project
npm install
npm run dev

I decided to continue working Chapter 5's next steps in the 05_01_b folder so I don't need to reinstall all the depencies

For the challenge in that Chapter, I've installed npm on 05_04b's nex-react-project folder instead of redoing all the instalations to avoid errors. It seems to work.

*** Update about the previous process on folder 05_04b. Error when commiting and pushing. Solution: I've did the challenge on folder 05_01b
